# About CanYouRead?
With help of the Azure Face API I've created something that will adjust the font size when people need to focus too much while reading. This will help elder people to find the right font-size and help young people decide if they are in need of some glasses.

## Functionalities
* Creating the right font-size.
* Helps people decide if they are in need of some glasses.
* An easy way to get into AI and API's

## Focused feature
During this project I want to help people find a right font-size:
* > As an elder, I want to know which font-size to use, so they can read on their devices.
* > As an adolescent, I want to know if my vision is okay, so I can check if I need glasses.

## Installation
Cloning the project `git clone https://github.com/Fr3akyBeakyLike/Project-Tech.git`

## This App is build using
